title: 'Demo 6b: Heterogeneous Agents - Different Languages'
teaser: The travel planner moves to Java and Spring AI. Per-step durability across
  a language boundary, over Nexus.

    # What if a specialist was written in a completely different language?

    Demo 6a showed different frameworks, same language. Demo 6b shows a
    different language entirely: the travel planner is reimplemented in
    Java with Spring AI.

    The Python orchestrator reaches it over Nexus - the same boundary it
    already uses for the F1 expert. The Java side shares no code with
    Python. They agree only on string names and JSON shapes.

    # The payoff: per-step durability across the language boundary

    In demo 6a the Strands travel planner was one opaque activity. The
    entire loop lived inside one event.

    In demo 6b the Spring AI travel planner gets per-step durability.
    Every LLM call and every tool call is its own Temporal activity -
    exactly like the OpenAI Agents SDK specialists.

    Compare the two histories side by side.

# Demo 6b: Heterogeneous Agents - Different Languages

## See the Big Picture First

Before you touch code, open the [button label="Architecture" background="#444CE7"](tab-7) tab to see how this demo fits together: three specialists behind one Python orchestrator, grouped by their four task queues and three worker processes (two Python, one Java).

The rose path is the one that matters here: the travel planner is reached over a **cross-language Nexus boundary** (Python to Java). Click any box to trace what it calls, or press **Play data flow** to watch a request fan out to all three specialists and back.

## What Changed from 6a

| | demo6a | demo6b |
|---|---|---|
| Travel planner language | Python | Java |
| Travel planner framework | Strands Agents SDK | Spring AI |
| Invocation from orchestrator | direct activity | Nexus operation |
| Durability of travel agent | coarse (whole loop = one activity) | per-step (each LLM/tool call = one activity) |

## The Nexus Contract

The Python caller and the Java handler share zero code. Every string name and JSON shape they agree on is in this table:

| | Python caller | Java handler |
|---|---|---|
| Endpoint name | `endpoint="travel-planner"` | worker on `travel-planner-agent-tq` |
| Service name | `class TravelPlannerService` | `@Service(name = "TravelPlannerService")` |
| Operation name | attr `ask_travel_planner` | `@Operation(name = "ask_travel_planner")` |
| Payload shapes | Pydantic `AskRequest{question}` / `AskResponse{answer}` | POJOs with `@JsonProperty("question")` / `("answer")` |

> [!NOTE]
> **Hands-on:** Do your coding in the `exercise/` directory. Want to see the working code? Peek at `solution/`.

## Wire Up the Nexus Call

In the [button label="Editor" background="#444CE7"](tab-6) tab, open `exercise/personal_assistant.py` and follow the `TODO`.

Stuck? Compare against `solution/personal_assistant.py`.

## Start the Java Worker

Click the [button label="Java Worker" background="#444CE7"](tab-0) terminal. Dependencies were pre-fetched in the image so this starts in seconds.

```bash,run
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You should see Maven build output, then Spring Boot startup logs ending in `Started WorkerApplication`:

```text
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[INFO]
[INFO] ------------< io.temporal.ai.workshop:travel-planner-java >-------------
[INFO] Building travel-planner-java 0.1.0

INFO  io.temporal.ai.workshop.travel.WorkerApplication : Started WorkerApplication in 4.2 seconds
```

> **If it fails:** a port-already-in-use error means a previous run's process is still bound - stop it with **Ctrl+C** in this tab and retry. Dependencies were pre-fetched in the image, so a slow first build usually means the image cache was skipped; retry once.

## Start the Python Workers

Click the [button label="Worker PA" background="#444CE7"](tab-1) terminal.

```bash,run
uv run python -m worker_pa
```

Click the [button label="Worker F1" background="#444CE7"](tab-2) terminal.

```bash,run
uv run python -m worker_f1
```

Each prints a `PA worker running:` / `F1 worker running:` banner, then keeps running. `OPENAI_API_KEY not set` means the key didn't carry into this terminal.

## Run It

Click the [button label="Starter" background="#444CE7"](tab-3) terminal.

```bash,run
uv run python -m start_workflow "What should I know about visiting Monaco?"
```

You should see travel advice about Monaco after a few seconds - now served by the Java worker instead of the demo6a Strands agent.

> **Predict before you look:** demo 6a's travel planner showed up as one opaque `ScheduleActivityTask` event. Given that the Java side uses Spring AI (not the Strands SDK), do you expect the same single-event shape, or something closer to the OpenAI Agents SDK's per-step activities? Check the next section.

## The Key Comparison

Open the [button label="Temporal UI" background="#444CE7"](tab-4) tab.

In the **orchestrator** history, the travel planner path now shows `NexusOperationScheduled` / `NexusOperationCompleted` instead of a single opaque activity event.

Then find the **`TravelPlannerAgentWorkflow`** on `travel-planner-agent-tq`. Its history shows per-step activities: a `ChatModelActivity` for each LLM call, individual activities for each tool call. That's Spring AI giving the Java agent the same per-step durability the OpenAI Agents SDK gives the Python agents.

## Break It: The Durability Test

Two languages, three worker processes, four task queues. Break the network and see how far the damage spreads.

**1. Turn off the service.** Click the [button label="Network Control Panel" background="#444CE7"](tab-5) tab and toggle **Weather** off. The Java worker does not call that host - its tools are Wikipedia and REST Countries.

**2. Run a workflow.** Click the [button label="Starter" background="#444CE7"](tab-3) terminal. Use a prompt that crosses the language boundary *and* needs weather:

```bash,run
uv run python -m start_workflow "What's the weather at the next F1 race and what should I know about visiting the destination?"
```

**3. Observe.** Switch to the [button label="Temporal UI" background="#444CE7"](tab-4) tab:

- The Python orchestrator is still **Running**.
- **`TravelPlannerAgentWorkflow`** on `travel-planner-agent-tq` - **Completed**. Its `ChatModelActivity` and per-tool activities all finished, over in the JVM.
- The orchestrator's `NexusOperationCompleted` for the travel planner is recorded.
- The weather child workflow's activity is **Retrying**.

Your [button label="Java Worker" background="#444CE7"](tab-0) terminal is quiet throughout. It has nothing to do.

**4. Answer this question.** Before you turn the service back on:

> A Python workflow is stuck retrying, and part of its answer came from a Java process it reached over Nexus. As those retries pile up, is the Java worker being asked to redo its work?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

No. The Nexus result is recorded in the Python orchestrator's history, and replay hands it back locally - no call crosses the process, language, or namespace boundary a second time.

Worth being precise about what makes this true. It is not that Nexus is special: it is that the **completion is an event**, the same way an activity result or a signal is. Every mechanism in this workshop reduces to that one idea.

And the Java side has the property demo 6a's Strands agent lacked. Because Spring AI's `@Tool` methods are also `@ActivityInterface` methods, a failure *inside* the travel agent retries only the step that failed - not the whole conversation. Same specialist role as 6a, opposite durability shape, and the orchestrator's code barely changed.
</details>

**5. Let it finish.** Toggle **Weather** back on in the [button label="Network Control Panel" background="#444CE7"](tab-5). The weather activity succeeds, and the [button label="Starter" background="#444CE7"](tab-3) prints one answer assembled from a Python child workflow, a Python Nexus service, and a Java Nexus service - none of which ran twice.

## Try More Prompts

Click the [button label="Starter" background="#444CE7"](tab-3) terminal.

```bash,run
uv run python -m start_workflow "What should I know about visiting Suzuka Circuit?"
```

```bash,run
uv run python -m start_workflow "When is the next F1 race?"
```

Click **Check** when you've run at least one workflow that invokes the Java travel planner.
